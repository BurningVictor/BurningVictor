. ðŸ‘‹ Hi, there! Iâ€™m Victor
.   Iâ€™m a fascinated by Rock'n Roll
.   I love Cine and Movies that break and open my mind
.   I'm a sick and a completely fanatic of Pink Floyd
.   I love books, HQs and mangas, but I'm very lazy to read them (unfortunately... *don't judge me :'(* )
.   I like to play videogame, and my favorite game is **The Witcher 3** (I literally have more than 200 hours of play)
. âœ¨ and, of course, I'm a dreamer... I dream that make something big, strong and memorable to leave a legacy before I die:
   and one of these dreams, it's me becoming a great and honorable Dev Full Stack.

It's a long way to get there, I know, but I trust that I'll get it! So... What the hell I'm waiting for??? Let's Code Space Cowboy!!!
